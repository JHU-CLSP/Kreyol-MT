This is web-scraped data from two different sources. The "combined unfiltered data comes from the National Assembly of Seychelles. 
It is 670K lines of data that are mostly CRS with some EN sentences mixed in as well as code-switching. 
At Nate's suggestion, I have not filtered separate the languaged out.
The  4k lines "nation_sc" data comes from "The Nation", a Seychellois newspaper. 
I did separate that in two stages using both off the shelf lang-id as well as a bootstrapped FastText model.
